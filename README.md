Verify real world facts to be used in smart contracts

## Problem space

DAPPs that prove and verify real world statements that:
 - Does not reveal personal information.
 - Are resistant to falsifibility.
 - Can be used by the person-object of the statement in smart contracts that will benefit form real world truths.

## Scope refinement
Reduce problem space to build feasable prototype. 

### Statments refinement:
Person-object linked to place at specific time. Link could be present / owns property / lives at.
As an example proof of physical address could be used to verify statement: Contract owner live in suburb/city/state/country. This could be used in a survey contract targeting citizens of the country.
